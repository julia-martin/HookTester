# HookTester
Similar to RequestBin, HookTester allows you to create a temporary URL for free with which you can test and debug webhooks. Our UI allows you to view the details of each webhook request.

This is a forked version of the original app, used for the purposes of testing and demoing Waypost's SDK's.
